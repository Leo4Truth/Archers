# Archers Online

## Rule ##

In the game, two player control an Archer respectively. The Archer survives in the end will be the winner.

The Archer can hurt his opponent by various arms, all these arms are shot to the opponent by his bow.

If some one fall down or be pushed out of the map, he will die immediately. And there is a space limit, as the duel proceeds, a red toxic circle will extend and leave the two archers less and less space to live. Archers in the toxic circle will not die immediately, but it will continuously lose HP until he leave there.
